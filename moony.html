          <p class="desc">
            Moony was born on August, 11, 2020 at the Companion Animal Alliance
            shelter in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She was adopted after a couple
            months, however, she did not stay long as she was a troubled kitten.
            She had a bad habit of using the bed and other soft surfaces as her
            toilet. Her owners were frustrated and did not want to put in
            effort, so they decided to return her back to CAA. She had to go
            back into being in a small display cage.

            I had been wanting to adopt a cat for a long time and started to
            look into the requirements of being a cat owner. After doing the
            research and getting all the necessary items (such as a carrier,
            litter box, water fountain, and more), I went to the Companion
            Animal Aliiance shelter to adopt a cat. I went around the cat area
            until I saw her. She looked at me with her big green eyes. She
            reminded me of a cat my father fed at his workplace, another tuxedo
            with a similar facial pattern. I hadn't told him that I was adopting
            a cat although we were living together. I thought that seeing a
            familiar cat would make him warm up sooner. After interacting with
            her in a private room, I decided that she was the one.
